- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PitifulTurnip

Im not really sure how to do this since im completely new to Github but i heard that i should post here if i have mod suggestions. These would be a few suggestions for countries like the Kumul Khanate (was playing them yesterday and was disappointed that they had no music),Ireland and Mongolia. Here are my suggestions :)

Kumul Khanate: (1) Gulyaraxn - This is a Uyghur song that is from Xinjiang. I realise that Kumul and Xinjiang are separate states, however a lot of their culture is probably shared and ultimately Kumul intends on being the rightful ruler of Xinjiang:)

(2) Turpan Folk song - Again another song from the Uyghur people in Xinjiang but as was said in the previous suggestion the proximity of Turpan to Kumul (right beside each other) means these two areas probably share a large amount of tradition and music.

(3) Unnamed Song - Even though its short its kind of nice to listen to

Mongolia: (1) The original Tanu Tuva Anthem - Seeing as Mongolia owns Tuva in the mod i thought this song could be added to the mongolia playlist. I know its a communist song but its quite relaxing and I thought it could be a nice addition to the pretty bare mongolia playlist :)

(2) A throat singing song about Genghis khan (i think) - Just imagine invading Russia while listening to this.... thats all you need to know lol (i think the video is from the genghis khan movie you should watch it i liked it a lot)

(3) Another suggestion for Mongolia is this. By the same guy who made the 2nd one above.

Ireland: (1) Caoineadh cu Chulainn - Just very nice and slow paced

(2) Eanach Dhuin - again a nice break from the fast paced rebel songs (though i do love those but variety is always good)

Hope these are okay :)
